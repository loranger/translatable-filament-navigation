Inspired by @teiuqpeek's [repository](https://github.com/teiuqpeek/navigation_spatie-translatable), here are some files to drop into a [Filament](https://filamentphp.com/) setup along with [Filament-navigation](https://github.com/ryangjchandler/filament-navigation/), [Translatable](https://filamentphp.com/plugins/filament-spatie-translatable) and [Language Switch](https://v2.filamentphp.com/plugins/language-switch) to get a localizable navigation bar
